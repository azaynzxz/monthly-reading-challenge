The air was cool and misty as I climbed the damp stone steps of the ancient temple, and I could feel the history beneath my feet. When I reached the top, I waited in silence and listened to the jungle waking up below me. Slowly, the sky turned a soft purple, and then it became a blazing orange, which highlighted the bell-shaped stupas. These are famous dome-like structures that have stood here like silent guardians since the 9th century. It amazes me to think that this massive site, which is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, was built without using a single drop of cement. As I looked out over the vast green canopy, I felt a deep sense of peace. It was a stillness that is so hard to find in the busy and noisy city I left behind."

Today, I sat at a busy roadside cafe and watched the chai-wala, who is the master tea maker, perform his daily magic. He poured the hot and milky tea from a great height into the cup, and he stretched the stream to make it perfectly frothy and bubbly. The rich and aromatic smell of cardamom and cinnamon filled the air, and it cut through the dust of the street. As I held the warm clay cup in my hands, I realized that taking this small break to connect with friends is actually the most important part of my day."

The smoky flavor of the rice, which was cooked slowly over firewood to give it that distinct taste, told me everything I needed to know. It was not just food, but it was also a delicious victory."
