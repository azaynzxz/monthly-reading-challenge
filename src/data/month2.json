We use a tennis ball wrapped in electrical tape, which we call a tape ball because it swings more. I bowl fast and aim for the plastic crate we use as a wicket. The game stops when a rickshaw passes and honks loudly, but nobody minds the interruption. This is our daily ritual of laughter and pure passion for cricket.",

The tape makes the ball heavier than a tennis ball, but not as hard or heavy as a cricket ball. As such, this modification seeks to reduce the risks to players, passers-by and property."

I dig my bare hands into the rich soil to pull out the precious vegetables, and my fingers are numb from the cold. After a few hours of work, we build an earth oven called a huatia by stacking stones and heating them with a wood fire until they glow red. We place the freshly harvested potatoes inside and cover the oven with grass and more earth. After an hour of slow cooking, we uncover the most delicious potatoes I have ever tasted. Eating a hot, steaming potato straight from the ground while I am surrounded by clouds and ancient mountains makes me feel incredibly wealthy, even though I have no money in my pockets.",

This peaceful village setting reminds me of the famous Malaysian animated series Upin and Ipin, which follows twin brothers living in a kampung just like this one with their beloved Opah, which means grandmother in Malay. The show has taught millions of children across Southeast Asia about Malaysian culture, family values, and the importance of community. I walk outside onto the wooden porch of the rumah panggung, which is what we call a traditional raised house built on stilts to keep cool and avoid flooding during monsoon season. My neighbor Mak Cik, which is the respectful term for an older woman, is already awake and preparing nasi kerabu, which is a famous Kelantanese dish of blue-colored rice served with herbs, fish, and spicy sambal. The blue color comes from butterfly pea flowers, and it looks almost too beautiful to eat. Children from the village are running barefoot between the houses, playing traditional games like congkak and gasing, which is a spinning top game that requires great skill. This simple kampung life, where neighbors know each other by name and everyone looks out for one another, represents the heart of Malaysian culture that Upin and Ipin has helped preserve for future generations.",

I am drinking shaah, which is the traditional Somali tea that I have loved since my earliest childhood memories. This special tea is brewed extremely strong and then mixed with generous amounts of powerful spices including cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and especially ginger, which gives it a warming heat that tingles on your tongue. The tea is always served very sweet because sugar is considered a sign of hospitality and prosperity in our culture. I sit here in the fading light of evening with several elders from my neighborhood, and I listen with respect as they recite beautiful classical poetry that has been passed down through oral tradition for hundreds of years. In Somali culture, poetry is one of the highest art forms, and skilled poets are celebrated and respected throughout society. We do not need televisions or the internet for our entertainment because we have something much more valuable. We have stories, and we have poems, and we have the wisdom of generations. And somehow, all of these ancient traditions flow more easily and taste more meaningful when accompanied by a cup of perfectly spiced tea.",

I walk slowly through the souq, which is the Arabic word for market, and I pass by small shops and stalls that have occupied the same locations for centuries.

Today, however, I am not here as a tourist to admire the ancient monuments. I am here to help cook plov for a traditional Uzbek wedding celebration, and this is a tremendous honor because plov is considered the national dish of Uzbekistan and the centerpiece of all important gatherings. We are using a massive cast-iron pot called a kazan that is so large it can cook enough rice to feed over three hundred guests, and this enormous vessel sits over an open wood fire that crackles and sends sparks dancing into the air. My specific job this morning is to chop the bright orange carrots, and there are so many carrots that my arms are getting tired from the repetitive motion. The traditional recipe calls for equal weights of rice, meat, and carrots, along with plenty of cumin, coriander, and whole garlic heads that will cook slowly and become soft and sweet. We layer all of the ingredients carefully in a specific order because the technique matters as much as the ingredients themselves. First goes the meat, which is lamb in this case, then the onions and carrots, then finally the rice on top. The pot is sealed with a heavy lid, and the plov cooks slowly for several hours while the flavors meld together into something magical. The anticipation builds throughout the afternoon as the complex and savory smell fills the entire neighborhood and draws people toward the celebration. When the time finally comes to uncover the kazan and pour the steaming plov onto the giant communal platter, the golden rice glistening with oil and dotted with tender meat and soft carrots, it feels like a true celebration of unity, community, and the ancient traditions that have sustained the people of Central Asia for thousands of years.",

Kalimantan is home to some of the oldest rainforests in the world, and scientists believe these forests have existed for over 130 million years, making them even older than the Amazon. Our klotok moves at a gentle pace because we are searching for orangutans, which are the great red apes that live only on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. The name orangutan comes from the Malay words orang hutan, which means person of the forest, and local people have always treated these intelligent creatures with respect. Suddenly, our guide points excitedly to a tree near the riverbank, and I see a mother orangutan with her baby clinging to her chest, watching us with curious eyes from high in the branches. The Dayak people, who are the indigenous tribes of Borneo, have lived in harmony with this forest for thousands of years, and their traditional longhouses can still be found in remote villages along the river.

I am looking up at the lush green mountains that embrace our city like protective arms, and a light mist is drifting down from the peaks this cool morning, creating a magical atmosphere that makes everything feel peaceful and new. In my hand is my breakfast: a perfectly grilled corn cake called an arepa that my mother prepared for me just minutes ago using techniques that have been passed down through our family for many generations. The arepa is one of the most ancient foods in the Americas, and indigenous peoples were making them long before Christopher Columbus arrived on these shores. My mother grilled this one on a traditional grill until it developed those characteristic black char marks on the outside, but when I break it open, the inside is beautifully soft and steaming hot. I place a thick slice of queso costeno, which is a salty white cheese from the Caribbean coast of Colombia, inside the arepa and watch as it begins to melt from the heat. Holding this warm and comforting corn cake on a cool mountain morning while the city slowly wakes up below me is one of the best feelings I know. It is such a humble and simple food, but it connects every Colombian to our shared history and to each other.

The locals sometimes call this mountain Ampleve, and it is the most famous natural feature in the entire region because its dramatic rocky peaks rise sharply from the flat surrounding plains and can be seen from many kilometers away. I came here with a plan to climb to the summit because the views from the top are supposed to be extraordinary, but nature has other plans for me today. Dark clouds are gathering quickly over the mountain, and I can smell the rain coming in the humid air that grows heavier with each passing minute. The first drops begin to fall, and within seconds, the sky opens up with the kind of tropical downpour that makes you understand why Mozambique has such lush vegetation during the rainy season. I run for shelter to a beautiful old building that catches my attention immediately because it looks so different from the simple concrete structures around it. This colonial era building was constructed by the Portuguese more than a century ago, back when Mozambique was a Portuguese colony and European administrators built grand houses throughout the country. The thick stone walls are painted a faded yellow that has weathered many decades of sun and rain, and the high ceilings with their wooden beams were designed to keep the interior cool during the hot African summers. A local man tells me that his company has purchased this historic building to house their employees, which means this piece of history is being preserved rather than left to crumble like so many other colonial structures across Africa. I visited Ribáuè once before in 2015, and I notice how much has changed since then because new buildings have appeared along the main road, yet the village still maintains its peaceful rural character. Children are playing in the rain, splashing through the red mud puddles with the pure joy that only children can express. The downpour continues for hours, and I watch from the covered porch of this hundred-year-old building as the mountain disappears completely behind curtains of grey rain. I will not climb Mount M'pàluwé today, but I have discovered something perhaps more valuable: a quiet moment in a village where the past and present exist together in harmony, where Portuguese architecture stands beside African traditions, and where the rhythm of life moves slowly enough to appreciate both the mountains and the rain.",

She has her small charcoal stove glowing red with heat, and the coals crackle and pop as she adds small sticks to keep the temperature just right. With expert speed and confidence born of decades of practice, she mixes strong black tea with aromatic spices including ginger, cinnamon, and cardamom, and she adds generous amounts of sugar because sweetness is considered essential for proper hospitality in Sudanese culture. The metal spoon clinks rhythmically against the glass as she stirs, and the sound is as familiar to me as my mother's voice. University students with their heavy textbooks, office workers in their pressed shirts, construction laborers with dust on their clothes, and retired elders with long white beards all sit together on plastic crates and wooden stools around her tiny stove.

The snow-capped peaks of the mighty Himalayas are hidden behind clouds today, but I know they are there, watching over the valley as they have for millions of years before humans ever walked this earth. I stop at a small and unassuming street stall that has become my favorite place in all of Kathmandu for one specific reason: they make the best momos in the city. Momos are Nepali dumplings that were originally brought here by Tibetan refugees who crossed the high mountain passes after the Chinese occupation of their homeland, and over the decades, Nepalis have adopted and adapted this dish until it has become an essential part of our own national cuisine. The dumplings are steaming in tall metal stacker containers, and the steam rises dramatically into the cold air, carrying with it the mouthwatering smell of seasoned meat, minced onions, and aromatic spices. I order a plate of buff momos, which are made with water buffalo meat because cows are sacred in Hindu Nepal and cannot be eaten. The cook places a generous portion in front of me, and I immediately dip one of the hot dumplings into the accompanying sauce, which is a spicy tomato and sesame chutney that provides a perfect balance of heat and tang. The first bite burns my tongue slightly because I am too impatient to let it cool properly, and I have to open my mouth and fan the steam with my hand while my friends laugh at my predictable mistake.

Our park ranger carries a long forked stick as we walk carefully through the dry savanna landscape, and he explains that this simple wooden tool is our only protection against the massive reptiles we have come to see. The Komodo dragon is the largest living lizard on Earth, growing up to three meters long and weighing over 70 kilograms, and it has existed in this remote corner of Indonesia for millions of years, making it a living dinosaur. We do not have to wait long before we spot our first dragon basking in the shade of a tamarind tree, and it is even more impressive and terrifying than I imagined. Its forked yellow tongue flicks in and out constantly, tasting the air for the scent of prey, and its powerful claws dig into the earth as it watches us with ancient, unblinking eyes. The ranger tells us that Komodo dragons have bacteria in their saliva that can cause deadly infections, and they are ambush predators capable of taking down water buffalo and deer with a single venomous bite. Flores itself is a beautiful island of volcanic mountains, traditional villages, and the famous tri-colored crater lakes of Kelimutu, which change color depending on the mineral content and the position of the sun.

        "text": "It is the middle of October, and I am standing on a steep rocky hillside in the Ajloun region of northern Jordan, where the air smells of pine trees, wild herbs, and the rich dark earth that has nurtured olive groves for thousands of years. This part of Jordan is covered with rolling hills and green valleys that look nothing like the desert landscapes that most foreigners imagine when they think of the Middle East, and the scenery here reminds many visitors of Tuscany or southern Spain. My entire extended family has gathered today for the annual olive harvest, which is one of the most important events in the Jordanian agricultural calendar and a tradition that connects us to our ancestors who planted and tended these very same trees generations ago. Some of the olive trees in our family's grove are absolutely ancient, with twisted and gnarled trunks that suggest they have been growing here for three hundred years or more. The oldest trees are treated with special reverence because they have witnessed so much history and have fed so many generations of our family through wars, droughts, and times of both hardship and prosperity. We spread large canvas sheets on the ground beneath each tree, and then we use long wooden rakes and poles to gently shake the branches and knock the ripe olives loose. The olives fall like black and green rain, and they bounce and roll on the sheets below. It is hard physical work that makes your shoulders and back ache by the end of the day, but my uncle keeps us motivated by singing old folk songs that his father taught him many decades ago, and we all join in on the familiar choruses. At midday, we stop working and spread a simple picnic lunch under the shade of the largest tree in the grove. We eat fresh khubz flatbread that my aunt baked in a taboon oven this morning, and we dip pieces of the warm bread into small dishes of olive oil that was pressed last year from the very trees that surround us. The oil is deep green and slightly peppery, with a richness that comes only from olives that have been grown in this particular soil and pressed within hours of harvesting. We are not wealthy people by any modern standard, but sitting here with my family, eating bread and oil that we produced ourselves from trees that our great-great-grandparents planted, I feel like the richest person in the entire world.",

        "imageDescription": "The olive is a species of subtropical evergreen tree in the family Oleaceae. Originating in Asia Minor, it is abundant throughout the Mediterranean Basin, with wild subspecies in Africa and western Asia; modern cultivars are traced primarily to the Near East, Aegean Sea, and Strait of Gibraltar. The olive is the type species for its genus, Olea, and lends its name to the Oleaceae plant family, which includes lilac, jasmine, forsythia, and ash. The olive fruit is classed botanically as a drupe, similar in structure and function to the cherry or peach. The term oil—now used to describe any viscous water-insoluble liquid—was originally synonymous with olive oil, the liquid fat derived from olives."
