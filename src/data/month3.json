The seller hands it to me, still warm from the pan. I eat it standing there, watching people rush by with their baskets full of vegetables. This simple breakfast connects me to my city's heartbeat."

My hands are getting tired, but the smell is amazing! Later, we will brew it strong and share it with everyone. This is how coffee should taste, made with patience and care."
